        <p>Welcome to my Data Visualization page, where we explore key trends and insights within the vegan and plant-based markets. Data visualization is a powerful tool that allows us to take datasets and present them in a way thatâ€™s easy to understand. This page aims to provide a clear, interactive experience to help you understand the growing impact of the vegan lifestyle worldwide, as well as the projected growth of plant-based products in the coming years.</p>
        <h1>Percentage of Vegans & Vegetarians by country</h1>

        <p>The first visualization is a line graph that shows the percentage of vegans and vegetarians by country. This graph allows us to compare how various nations around the globe have adopted plant-based diets. By plotting both vegan and vegetarian percentages side-by-side, we can observe how dietary trends differ and where plant-based lifestyles are gaining the most traction. Each point on the graph represents a country, and the data highlights the growing global interest in reducing animal product consumption.</p>

        <h1>Plant-Based Product Sales Growth</h1>
        <p>Our bar graph presents a closer look at the sales and projected growth of plant-based products. This chart compares current sales figures to the forecasted market expansion, giving a glimpse into the increasing consumer demand for plant-based meat, dairy alternatives, beverages, and other products. The data reflects the significant economic impact of the plant-based sector, which continues to grow as more consumers shift towards sustainable and ethical eating habits.</p>

        <p>Attempted to add this map graph. Went through some errors and I decided to leave it as is. I tried both API & manual Json data and it refused to work. The tooltip is not rendering on hover, but I am planning to fix it in the future as time ran out. </p>
