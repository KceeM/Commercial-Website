            <h1>My Journey to Plant-Based Living</h1>
            <article>
                <p>In 2020, during the global pandemic caused by <strong>COVID-19</strong> - a highly contagious virus that led to respiratory illnesses, hospitalizations, and millions of deaths worldwide - I became increasingly concerned about my health.With people around me falling ill, I realized how vulnerable we all were. COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets, and its severity varies, but those with underlying health conditions were particularly at risk.</p>
                <p>In <strong>March 2020</strong>, I decided to take action by becoming <strong>pescatarian</strong>, which meant incorporating more plant-based meals into my diet and consuming chicken and fish instead of red meat. I had about 2-3 meatless meals a week, but cutting out red meat was one of the hardest adjustments I faced. After watching several documentaries and YouTube videos highlighting the health risks of red meat, including increased risks of heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers. I knew I had to make this change for my health.</p>

                <p>As the pandemic worsened, so did my worries. In <strong>June 2020</strong>, my grandfather passed away, and soon after, I contracted COVID-19 at his funeral. The virus hit fast, and my family and I became very ill after that funeral. My mother, who already suffered from a chronic illness, was hospitalized due to severe complications. During this time, I lost my sense of taste, which ironically pushed me to fully embrace a vegan lifestyle. I realized that meat wasn’t helping me heal, and my body needed something different. I cooked a spicy vegan soup, which we all ate, and within 2/3 days, we began to gradually recover. 
                My mom returned from the hospital after a week, she did not get to see us in the horrible state we were in. However, after recovering I knew from that moment on I would commit fully to this lifestyle.</p>

                <p>Going vegan felt like a natural transition after starting as pescatarian. My body felt lighter, my energy improved, and even my mental clarity became sharper.
                However, living in <strong>South Africa</strong>, where most people don’t understand or support plant-based living, it hasn’t been easy. Many people judge my choices, but I’ve remained steadfast. It has been about 4 years in this journey and I actually transitioned to vegetarian two years ago, mainly because of cheese and I love baking and found it challenging to switch entirely to plant-based ingredients while still living at home. I kept vegan principles in many areas of my life such as drinking almond milk or soy milk and maintained a plant-focused diet overall.</p>

                <p>This lifestyle has completely transformed me. It made me more mindful, energized, and healthy, even in a country that doesn’t always support this way of living. That’s why I created this website, to inspire others to explore plant-based living. Even small changes, like having meatless meals a few times a week or joining the lifestyle with a cheat meal once a month, it can significantly impact your health and the planet.</p>
                <p>The truth is, I used to love the taste of meat, but after going vegan, I found it unpleasant, which taught me that the body can adapt and change. I encourage you to give it a try, whether it’s vegan, vegetarian, or just cutting down on meat. You’re making a step towards better health, and trust me...</p>

                <p><strong>Your body will thank you later!</strong></p>
