            <h1>Critical Reflection Essay</h1>
            <p>The website I created is based on living a plant-based lifestyle therefore it focuses on expressing the importance of it through blog posts, data visualizations, recipes and products. Personal experiences are shared through my profile about how I got inspired into transitioning and the positive change it brought into my life. The main brief stated that the theme can be based on a passionate topic and since I have been part of the plant-based community for over 4 years, I decided that it is best to create this website on this very controversial yet highly beneficial lifestyle. The aim of this essay is to reflect on the global economics and artistic implications of the web technologies and design techniques used during the development of my data visualizations. The decisions made for the user-interface (UI) and user experience (UX) will be evaluated through the role of interactivity, mentioning the challenges faced during the development process and analysing how my website aligns with professional international web development practices. </p>
            <p>The use of web technologies like D3.js for dynamic data visualization, HTML/CSS/JS for UI & UX design, and the integration of APIs highlighted economic challenges, particularly related to accessing data. It really was the most crucial challenge for me during my entire development process and I will get into the reasoning behind this. The Spoonacular API, despite being one of the few reliable live data sources for plant-based recipes, products and information. It had significant limitations due to strict call limitations and pricing structures that I only discovered after using the same API during my second graph (the bar graph). Since the first time I created the graphs, I did not use the API as it was irresponsive. It led to using online data and manually recording it in json files to finish my previous assignment on time as I had given up on the API. I recreated my graphs using the API during the exam period and that is when I discovered that although Spoonacular is free, it has limitations. When the developer reaches their limits, they disable the API code and request payment. This posed a recurring challenge, as frequent console warnings indicated reaching usage limits. I had to use multiple emails to retrieve new API keys to extend functionality temporarily. This issue causes frustration during programming because after making changes to the codes, the website page must be refreshed to view the changes, therefore leading to my call counts being at risk for all my graphs on the page. I went through this several times when viewing a specific graph, my other graphs that were complete would randomly disappear due to APIs being disabled. The financial constraints means that it is not friendly to developers working on smaller projects posing an economic challenge.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there is data that the API failed to fetch accurately such as protein, likes and carbohydrates data as I attempted to incorporate more information into my graphs. The information it fetched accurately are the health scores, popularity and prices. Unfortunately, this restricted my data visualizations. I desperately wanted to use protein data to compare protein in vegetarian meals and meat dishes as one of the main reasons people do not support the lifestyle is due to protein deficiency concerns. If the data was fetched correctly, it could have visually communicated the possibilities of being able to live on the lifestyle therefore encouraging users with limited beliefs. However, the health scores and prices were impressive as I used it to indicate that the lifestyle is inexpensive since healthy food is generalised to be “more expensive” and is used as an excuse for human beings to doubt the lifestyle. The final graph was then used as a comparison between vegetarian/vegan meals and meat meals, and it clearly indicates that majority of meat dishes are more expensive. I loved seeing this, although I have always known ever since making comparisons in my personal life, it heightened my awareness seeing how true it is through live data.  The visual elements used remained engaging especially when interactivity was added to my bubble graph. Animations were added on hover which gives life to the data. The engagement increased as filtering of information was added, so that the user can view specific data when clicking the checkbox and being able to leave a comment. I wanted the user to be able to filter data by adjusting points on a slider and searching for recipes through ingredients, but time ran out and I left it the way it is as I felt that what I did was enough for the requirement. The decision that motivated the creation of my data visualisation graphs stemmed from wanting to create a common graph I was used to seeing (bar graph) and graphs I found interesting (line graph and bubble chart). Data visualizations like bar graphs, line graphs, bubble charts, and more can significantly improve the comprehensibility of complex datasets. Including tooltips and interactivity in graphs helps users gain insight through intuitive exploration. Websites like D3.js (https://d3js.org/ ) and articles on designing effective data visualizations offer guidance on creating dynamic graphs that communicate data effectively (ByteScrum Technologies 2024)</p>
            <p>The website user design focused on user engagement and clarity through intuitive data visualizations and interactive elements through transitions and animations. Krug (2014) emphasizes that web usability hinges on intuitive navigation and easily recognizable interactions. When users don't need to pause and ponder how to proceed on a page, their experience becomes fluid and engaging. Applying this approach to my website design ensures that users can seamlessly interact with the interface. The homepage aims to introduce the main theme of the website. Using d3.js I implemented animations for my heading text and for my profile introduction using typewriter technique. Each graph was introduced with contextual information, guiding users through data interpretation and interaction through tooltips for data specific information. Therefore, users can hover on each data point to view information encouraging interaction whilst learning more. The bubble graph, for example, dynamically responds to user interactions, helping interpret complex data with visual cues and tooltips. Challenges like bubbles being cut off or text overflowing were resolved by adjusting SVG margins and refining scales. Bubble graph interactivity was enhanced through filtering mechanisms and a comment section, creating a more meaningful experience. It all plays a role in user engagement and interactivity as the existing interactions demonstrate the potential for rich user experiences. Duckett illustrates how JavaScript enhances user interaction by adding dynamic behaviors, such as animations and transitions (2014). The use of button logic being implemented consistently contributes to the UI & UX. This is including hover states, colors, and clicks, is crucial for enhancing user experience and directing behavior on websites. Implementing logical states for buttons, such as color changes on hover, animations, and interactions, helps guide users' attention and improves navigation. Proper button design also ensures accessibility and consistency in functionality (Babich 2016).</p>
            <p>Kleppmann (2017) delves into the complexities of building scalable, data-driven web systems, underscoring the importance of data consistency and reliability. Incorporating Spoonacular data into my graphs and handling API limits required a strategic approach, reflecting Kleppmann's ideas on making data handling robust while keeping performance in mind. As mentioned previously, significant obstacles arose with API integrations, but some issues were resolved. Besides Spoonacular's restrictions on call limits which was resolved by using several emails, there were issues with data accuracy especially for meat and vegetarian data. It required API URL adjustments to maintain accurate data fetching. Documentation reviews were essential for resolving data inconsistencies. Here is the link to the Spoonacular document that assisted throughout the development process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs "> Spoonacular API Documentation </a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The decision to stick with Spoonacular stemmed from the lack of available alternatives, further complicating the development process but provided stable enough support for continued development. Here are the alternative APIs I tried to implement and explore:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> World Bank API for the map visualization. While it is a free and open-source resource offering data on global development, economics, and population statistics. The datasets were not specifically tailored to vegan/vegetarian dietary data, making it less suitable for my website.</li>
                <li> Edamam API offers limited free usage, but the features required for advanced data often require a paid plan.</li>
                <li> Nutritionix API is free for basic queries, but advanced nutritional data and extensive calls may require a premium plan. Therefore, limiting the nutritional data I require for my website. </li>
                <li> Open Food Facts API – Had a broad dataset but lacked reliability and depth for specific health scores and pricing data for plant-based content. It is an open-source and free option which is a benefit, but data reliability and specific issues arose during my project development. Leading to fully relying on Spoonacular API as it was the most sufficient.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Coding challenges were resolved through debugging cycles for the data visualization page, although it led to constant page refreshes that resulted in reaching API limitations. The debugging and checking the console for certain errors that arise, helped with the development process when finding solutions to make the code function. In terms of the colour scheme, I tried to be consistent as the logo is orange and green. Thus, I attempted to use colours that complement the main colours. Since, green is used as a signifier for plant-based lifestyle because of the ideas around its connection to nature. Green is commonly used to signify a connection to nature, health, and growth, which aligns well with plant-based themes (Madhu 2023). It evokes feelings of renewal, tranquility, and environmental responsibility. This association is frequently employed in branding to emphasize eco-friendly or health-conscious product (Design Dash 2024). I had to focus more on that colour and the background remains white to keep the appeal clean and neat as it semiotically represents the ideas around veganism/vegetarianism. White backgrounds are often used to create a sense of openness, cleanliness, and simplicity on websites. They help emphasize key elements without distraction and create a clean, minimalist aesthetic that makes content and other colors stand out clearly (Madhu 2023).</p>
            <p>This project aligns with international web development standards by focusing on user-centric design, data interactivity, API integration and marketing through affiliate links. The commercial aspect of the website is represented through engaging blog posts, recipes and products. The focus on vegan/vegetarian data and health metrics aligns with the theme, making it relevant and tailored for the target audience, as seen in professional niche markets worldwide. The use of APIs for real-time data retrieval for recipes and interactive data visualizations demonstrates modern commercial design practices for creating engaging user experiences. Regarding SEO & accessibility considerations, the use of proper structuring of elements, semantic tags, and interactive content ensure accessibility and align with international. For responsiveness, web pages are designed for optimal display across devices, and it aligns with global accessibility and mobile standards. There is a lot of room for improvement for this website, however I tried to implement enough profession web principles throughout the website. The website needs more attention when it comes to aesthetics as it does not meet the standards of other professional websites, therefore it needs to be improved. Web design requires a balance between aesthetic appeal and usability, as design choices greatly impact how users perceive and interact with content. Consistency in visual elements, typography, and interactive features ensures a cohesive experience that aligns with international standards (Chapman 2006). However, despite time constraints and data limitations, adherence to UI/UX principles, interactive elements, and accessible data visualization techniques ensured a professional approach.</p>

            <h1>Critical Analysis Essay</h1>
            <p>This data journalism project is based on the data visualization represented by The New York Times for the Corona Virus outbreak. The records are stored on the company’s page which is titled, “Coronavirus World Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak” (The New York Times, 2023). The duration of the data is from 2020 until March 2023 clearly highlighting the different categories of the pandemic such as “New reported cases by day”, “New reported deaths by day”, “Cases by region”, “Hot spots” and “Reported cases, deaths and vaccinations by country”. In this project, an in-depth analysis will be made on the use of various aspects on data visualization that has been used on their platform, such as interactivity, user engagement, UI/UX design, data driven storytelling, narrative elements and more useful techniques. Integrating data with dynamic visual representations enables the creation of visualizations that not only convey information clearly but also empower users to engage interactively, uncovering more profound insights through exploration (Bostock, Ogievetsky, and Heer, 2011).  </p>
            <p>When engaging with the website at first, you see the title and the notification of the duration of the data in the colour yellow. It is important to notify the user to make them aware that the information is not current data as it has been archived, indicating that the company no longer updates its records. The user may be searching for current data depending on what the purpose of their research is, but it may influence their intentions. However, this analysis is based on the visualization of data irrespective of time. The way in which the records are represented is still valid to its users who choose to engage with it. The two graphs for the “New reported cases by day” in red and the “New reported deaths by day” in grey are placed side by side, giving the user a full overview of both records making it easy for comparisons. According to Ware (2012), the choice of colours in a data visualization can significantly influence the viewer's emotional response and understanding of the data. The colour red is associated with danger, urgency, or alertness, making it an appropriate choice for rising cases as it also makes it stand out. The colour grey conveys a sense of dullness, calmness or absence signalling the severity of the pandemic’s impact. It may also represent something that has been discarded or indicating matters of the “past” such as death. Both line charts being next to one another shows the real effects of the coronavirus. Therefore, colour is used as a tool to signify something, and comparison infographics helps the user make informed decisions (Ploger, 2022).</p>
            <img class="essay-image" src="images/d2.png">
            <p>In terms of the various visual techniques used to represent data, the company makes use of a wide range of techniques in the form of interactive maps, bar graphs and line charts. It is used to illustrate trends and comparisons globally with the option to view more data across different countries and regions. Infographics are easily processed by the brain rather than text (Ploger, 2022). It is evident in the content shown by New York Times as all their categories makes use of different types of infographics to represent their data. The inconsistency alleviates the potential boredom the user may experience from repetitive use of graphs or charts. Instead, the company strategically makes each category have a unique representation of data. This adds to a more engaging user experience as the average human attention span continues to decline because of distractions from social media, the internet and/or the environment, currently averaged to 8,25 seconds (Samba Recovery, 2024). When creating engageable data, factors such as a human’s average attention span needs to be put into consideration. Thus, the company may already be aware of this which influences the use of different forms of infographics whilst ensuring that it is interactable.</p>
            <p>Interactivity is an important technique used in UI/UX design because the user must be able to engage with the content to create an experience. Alan Cooper (2014) states that interactivity is a cornerstone of effective UI/UX design because it allows users to engage actively with content, which is crucial in shaping a memorable and meaningful experience. Don Norman (2013) emphasizes that without meaningful interaction, users are less likely to engage with and remember the information presented to them. Thus, strategically thinking about interactive design is extremely important. An interesting way that the New York Times implements this is through hovering interactions. When the user hovers over line charts, it reveals key information at that exact point. This creates easy navigation and an interesting user experience as the company ensures that the data has a responsive design. This interactive motion adds life to the static visuals, allowing users to actively engage with the data. In terms of data driven storytelling, there is not much information through text. It is evident that the motive for this page is to mainly showcase data, therefore the company prioritizes their visual infographics. Tversky (2019) argues that organizing data into a visual narrative can improve user comprehension and retention, as it aligns with cognitive principles that make complex information more relatable and easier to understand. Thus, using infographics is an efficient way to have well-structured visual narratives. In terms of text, they give a brief overview at the end of the page whilst including ‘About this data’ links at the end of each graph to reveal a very short description about the data. At the end, there is a section recommending more articles that are related to the pandemic that the user has the option to interact with. It encourages further engagement about the topic.</p>
            <p>Although their infographics comes in the form of multiple visual data representations that shows how ‘inconsistency’ may benefit user engagement. There are many other factors in which they remain very consistent such as the colour palette and interactivity. In the beginning of this analysis, colour was highlighted in the first line charts as red (refers to reported covid cases) and grey (refers to the death cases) are used intentionally. The same concept is used in the global overview map, which is a sign of ‘consistency’. The “Hot spots” section shows the areas with the highest covid-19 cases per capita by featuring a heat map of orange and red tones. The areas with the most intense outbreaks are shown in darker tones and the least outbreaks are shown in lighter tones, which helps the user quickly identify the areas where the virus is spreading most rapidly. Therefore, colour is strategically used for identification and effective readability.</p>
            <p>Interactivity is extended through the option to view country specific data which is accessible on all the categories. This option is available as dropdown menus seen at the top of the first line graph. The user may select any country, for example - the reported cases for South Africa is selected in the image below. However, the rest of the infographics that the user may still want to engage with are not shown on that page. It redirects the user to the page for the country specific data selected. Therefore, the user would have to go back to the first default page to access the rest of the categories and graphs. This hinders accessibility as the user may find it tedious to continuously go back and forth through the pages as they view country specific data. Another section that incorporates country specific data searches is the final category at the end of the page which sorts the most cases per 100000 residents, and it includes an interactive element to search countries. Unlike the previous country specific data, the user still has access to the rest of the records under other categories as it does not redirect them to a new page, allowing for seamless navigation and uninterrupted access to all data. As Steve Krug (2014) argues that users should be able to access all content easily without being redirected or interrupted, which ensures a smooth and efficient user experience as he advocates for intuitive navigation.</p>
            <p>The “Cases by region” section is represented by a line chart and this method may be used for comparisons to indicate how one variable is superior or inferior to another (Ploger, 2022).  When a user hovers over specific points on the lines, it reveals the data for each region at that point. This makes the user experience simple to understand and interact with as it is direct. Lastly, the option to see data from the last 90 days is available and for this section the same method of line charts is used. However, the first data for the “new reported cases and deaths” merges both line chart and bar graph into one, which adds to the ‘inconsistent’ aspect mentioned previously. There is nothing wrong with this idea as it broadens the expectations and allows the user to view the same data from a different perspective.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the data visualization techniques used are strategically implemented to enhance usability throughout the page. It encourages users to interact with the data by incorporating hover interactions to enhance engagement and improve data comprehension. The idea to represent data through multiple types of infographics breaks the boundaries of consistency, drawing more attention to the information. Giving the user options to search for specific countries expands their interaction capabilities and colour is used effectively to symbolize certain aspects of the data. The company’s motives behind their UI/UX design stems from strategic and informed decisions that make it suitable for users to engage with. </p>
