            <h1>Critical Analysis Essay</h1>
            <p>This data journalism project is based on the data visualization represented by The New York Times for the Corona Virus outbreak. The records are stored on the company’s page which is titled, “Coronavirus World Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak” (The New York Times, 2023). The duration of the data is from 2020 until March 2023 clearly highlighting the different categories of the pandemic such as “New reported cases by day”, “New reported deaths by day”, “Cases by region”, “Hot spots” and “Reported cases, deaths and vaccinations by country”. In this project, an in-depth analysis will be made on the use of various aspects on data visualization that has been used on their platform, such as interactivity, user engagement, UI/UX design, data driven storytelling, narrative elements and more useful techniques. Integrating data with dynamic visual representations enables the creation of visualizations that not only convey information clearly but also empower users to engage interactively, uncovering more profound insights through exploration (Bostock, Ogievetsky, and Heer, 2011).  </p>
            <p>When engaging with the website at first, you see the title and the notification of the duration of the data in the colour yellow. It is important to notify the user to make them aware that the information is not current data as it has been archived, indicating that the company no longer updates its records. The user may be searching for current data depending on what the purpose of their research is, but it may influence their intentions. However, this analysis is based on the visualization of data irrespective of time. The way in which the records are represented is still valid to its users who choose to engage with it. The two graphs for the “New reported cases by day” in red and the “New reported deaths by day” in grey are placed side by side, giving the user a full overview of both records making it easy for comparisons. According to Ware (2012), the choice of colours in a data visualization can significantly influence the viewer's emotional response and understanding of the data. The colour red is associated with danger, urgency, or alertness, making it an appropriate choice for rising cases as it also makes it stand out. The colour grey conveys a sense of dullness, calmness or absence signalling the severity of the pandemic’s impact. It may also represent something that has been discarded or indicating matters of the “past” such as death. Both line charts being next to one another shows the real effects of the coronavirus. Therefore, colour is used as a tool to signify something, and comparison infographics helps the user make informed decisions (Ploger, 2022).</p>
            <img class="essay-image" src="images/d2.png">
            <p>In terms of the various visual techniques used to represent data, the company makes use of a wide range of techniques in the form of interactive maps, bar graphs and line charts. It is used to illustrate trends and comparisons globally with the option to view more data across different countries and regions. Infographics are easily processed by the brain rather than text (Ploger, 2022). It is evident in the content shown by New York Times as all their categories makes use of different types of infographics to represent their data. The inconsistency alleviates the potential boredom the user may experience from repetitive use of graphs or charts. Instead, the company strategically makes each category have a unique representation of data. This adds to a more engaging user experience as the average human attention span continues to decline because of distractions from social media, the internet and/or the environment, currently averaged to 8,25 seconds (Samba Recovery, 2024). When creating engageable data, factors such as a human’s average attention span needs to be put into consideration. Thus, the company may already be aware of this which influences the use of different forms of infographics whilst ensuring that it is interactable.</p>
            <p>Interactivity is an important technique used in UI/UX design because the user must be able to engage with the content to create an experience. Alan Cooper (2014) states that interactivity is a cornerstone of effective UI/UX design because it allows users to engage actively with content, which is crucial in shaping a memorable and meaningful experience. Don Norman (2013) emphasizes that without meaningful interaction, users are less likely to engage with and remember the information presented to them. Thus, strategically thinking about interactive design is extremely important. An interesting way that the New York Times implements this is through hovering interactions. When the user hovers over line charts, it reveals key information at that exact point. This creates easy navigation and an interesting user experience as the company ensures that the data has a responsive design. This interactive motion adds life to the static visuals, allowing users to actively engage with the data. In terms of data driven storytelling, there is not much information through text. It is evident that the motive for this page is to mainly showcase data, therefore the company prioritizes their visual infographics. Tversky (2019) argues that organizing data into a visual narrative can improve user comprehension and retention, as it aligns with cognitive principles that make complex information more relatable and easier to understand. Thus, using infographics is an efficient way to have well-structured visual narratives. In terms of text, they give a brief overview at the end of the page whilst including ‘About this data’ links at the end of each graph to reveal a very short description about the data. At the end, there is a section recommending more articles that are related to the pandemic that the user has the option to interact with. It encourages further engagement about the topic.</p>
            <p>Although their infographics comes in the form of multiple visual data representations that shows how ‘inconsistency’ may benefit user engagement. There are many other factors in which they remain very consistent such as the colour palette and interactivity. In the beginning of this analysis, colour was highlighted in the first line charts as red (refers to reported covid cases) and grey (refers to the death cases) are used intentionally. The same concept is used in the global overview map, which is a sign of ‘consistency’. The “Hot spots” section shows the areas with the highest covid-19 cases per capita by featuring a heat map of orange and red tones. The areas with the most intense outbreaks are shown in darker tones and the least outbreaks are shown in lighter tones, which helps the user quickly identify the areas where the virus is spreading most rapidly. Therefore, colour is strategically used for identification and effective readability.</p>
            <p>Interactivity is extended through the option to view country specific data which is accessible on all the categories. This option is available as dropdown menus seen at the top of the first line graph. The user may select any country, for example - the reported cases for South Africa is selected in the image below. However, the rest of the infographics that the user may still want to engage with are not shown on that page. It redirects the user to the page for the country specific data selected. Therefore, the user would have to go back to the first default page to access the rest of the categories and graphs. This hinders accessibility as the user may find it tedious to continuously go back and forth through the pages as they view country specific data. Another section that incorporates country specific data searches is the final category at the end of the page which sorts the most cases per 100000 residents, and it includes an interactive element to search countries. Unlike the previous country specific data, the user still has access to the rest of the records under other categories as it does not redirect them to a new page, allowing for seamless navigation and uninterrupted access to all data. As Steve Krug (2014) argues that users should be able to access all content easily without being redirected or interrupted, which ensures a smooth and efficient user experience as he advocates for intuitive navigation.</p>
            <p>The “Cases by region” section is represented by a line chart and this method may be used for comparisons to indicate how one variable is superior or inferior to another (Ploger, 2022).  When a user hovers over specific points on the lines, it reveals the data for each region at that point. This makes the user experience simple to understand and interact with as it is direct. Lastly, the option to see data from the last 90 days is available and for this section the same method of line charts is used. However, the first data for the “new reported cases and deaths” merges both line chart and bar graph into one, which adds to the ‘inconsistent’ aspect mentioned previously. There is nothing wrong with this idea as it broadens the expectations and allows the user to view the same data from a different perspective.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the data visualization techniques used are strategically implemented to enhance usability throughout the page. It encourages users to interact with the data by incorporating hover interactions to enhance engagement and improve data comprehension. The idea to represent data through multiple types of infographics breaks the boundaries of consistency, drawing more attention to the information. Giving the user options to search for specific countries expands their interaction capabilities and colour is used effectively to symbolize certain aspects of the data. The company’s motives behind their UI/UX design stems from strategic and informed decisions that make it suitable for users to engage with. </p>
